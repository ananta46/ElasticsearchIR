This initiative promotes collaboration between businesses and universities, enhancing the capacity of university personnel and preparing students and recent graduates in tourism and related fields with essential skills and modern technological challenges. Funded by the European Union and the College of Arts, Media, and Technology, Chiang Mai University, this project marks a significant step forward. On Monday, June 17, 2024, the working team from Chiang Mai University, including Assistant Professor Dr. Yuthasak Chatkaewnapanon, Head of the Department of Tourism, Faculty of Humanities; Associate Professor Dr. Pradthana Jaipong, Director of CMU Lifelong Education; Assistant Professor Dr. Uraiwan Hanwong, Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Education; Assistant Professor Dr. Orawit Thinnukool, Project Steering Committee; and Assistant Professor Dr. Pattaraporn Khuwuthyakorn, Project Leader, welcomed entrepreneurs and tourism network partners at the \"INNO4Tourism - National Project Launch Event\" held at the ASTRA Innovation Research and Development Consulting Center, 3rd floor, College of Arts, Media, and Technology, Chiang Mai University. The event aimed to raise awareness among students, graduates, and university personnel about the changing demands in the tourism industry, especially the necessary skill adjustments required to compete with new market trends. The INNO4Tourism project (Innovative Curricula for Life-Long Learning of Sustainable Tourism Workforce) is funded by the European Union under the Erasmus+ program's Capacity Building in Higher Education (CBHE) Action for a duration of three years (December 1, 2023 – November 30, 2026). With a total budget of 748,055 Euros (approximately 29 million Baht), the project aims to support higher education institutions in Thailand and Laos to enhance the capabilities of students and personnel in the tourism industry. It promotes awareness of sustainable tourism with key outcomes including the establishment of Career Offices at four partner universities in Thailand and Laos, which will serve as mechanisms linking education and the tourism industry (University-Business Cooperation: UBC mechanisms), and the development of online courses consisting of eight modules related to tourism management and essential IT skills. The event featured a panel discussion on \"The Role of Universities in Transforming the Tourism and Service Industry for Sustainability in the Era of Modern Society and Technology\", with five special guests from the government tourism sector, private tourism businesses, and Chiang Mai University faculty. The panelists included Mr. Jirakorn Suwong, Secretary-General of the Chiang Mai Tourism Industry Council; Mr. Suksan Chutintaratip, Executive Chef of Meli? Chiang Mai Hotel; Ms. Thitiphak Tonwan, Human Resources & Training Supervisor at Meli? Chiang Mai; Assistant Professor Dr. Yutthasak Chatkaewnapanon, Head of the Department of Tourism, Faculty of Humanities, Chiang Mai University; Associate Professor Dr. Prathana Jaiphong, Director of the College of Lifelong Education, Chiang Mai University; and Assistant Professor Dr. Patitson Palee, Deputy Dean of the College of Arts, Media, and Technology, who shared their experiences and insights. In addition to the discussions, there was a ceremony to hand over a complete set of computers and meeting equipment, along with a server for the ASTRA Innovation Research and Development Consulting Center, funded by the European Union in the 2020-2023 project, valued at over 2 million Baht. The equipment was presented by Mr. Thammanun Nuamanong, Deputy Director of the Office of the University, who oversees research policies and the ASTRA project, and was received by Assistant Professor Dr. Patitson Palee, Deputy Dean of the College of Arts, Media, and Technology. This project is expected to create a socio-impact related to value creation in tourism services and sustainability by developing the skills of new graduates and local entrepreneurs to compete in alignment with the circular economy. This aligns with Chiang Mai University's SDGs, and the strategic focus of the College of Arts, Media, and Technology on innovation for sustainability.
